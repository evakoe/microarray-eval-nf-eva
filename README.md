# microarray-eval-nf

A nextflow pipeline to test imputation quality of simulated microarrays.

## Development
```
git clone https://github.com/seppinho/microarray-eval-nf
cd microarray-eval-nf
docker build -t genepi/microarray-eval:latest . # don't ignore the dot
```
If you have not yet done this, under Linux you need to create a group docker and add your user to it.
```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker <username>
```

## Run Chip Simulation
This command simulates array data from sequencing data for references ```ref=hg19``` or ```ref=hg38```.
For each strand file included in ```tests/data/strand_data/${ref}/```, and each sequencing file included in ```tests/data/sequence_data/${ref}/``` a simulated array will be created. The output is stored in ```output/simulate_${ref}```
```
nextflow run main.nf -c tests/simulate_${ref}.config -profile development
```

## Run Genotype Imputation
To perform imputation from the simulated genotype arrays, you need to use this imputation workflow
```
git clone https://github.com/genepi/imputationserver2
```
You may use the example test config in ```conf/test_three_vcf.config``` to create a config file that will the imputation for each of your simulated arrays. After imputation is complete, you may copy the imputed data back to this working directory under ```tests/data/imputed_data/${ref}/```

## Run RSQ Calculation
This command calculates the RSQ between sequencing data and imputed data for each imputed file in ```tests/data/imputed_data/${ref}/```. 
```
nextflow run main.nf -c tests/calc_rsq_${ref}.config -profile development
```
Results are stored ioutput/calc_rsq_{ref}/ 

## Run Tests
````
./nf-test test
